# Solarized Light Functional Theme

![Screenshot](Screenshot_02.png)

All functions in the code clearly stand out with the light theme.

Originally tailored for JavaScript but it should work
fine with other languages too.

## How to customize to your taste

Use this app `http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/` for the original `tmTheme`.

You can even load it directly from the url.

Or you can work on it directly from code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_adding-a-new-color-theme

Ask if you need any assistance

**Enjoy!**
